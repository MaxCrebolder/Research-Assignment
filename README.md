**Improving Forecast Accuracy for Offshore Wind Turbine Installation**

The scripts made in this GitHub file are used to model three separate models, namely a Hybrid ARIMA-ANN model (hybrid_final_model), a Bayesian Neural Network with Monte Carlo Dropout (BNN_with_MCD_final_model) and a Long-Short Term Memory Model (final_lstm_model).
Other scripts in the GitHub are used during the hyper-parameter tuning phase of the model.

**Prerequisites**

MATLAB R2024a or newer with:
- Statistics & Machine Learning Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Parallel Computing Toolbox
